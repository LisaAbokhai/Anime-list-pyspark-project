# Pyspark-with-jupypter-notebook

## The aim of this project

This project was used to practice Pyspark with a dataset already extracted from a previous project. I inspected the dataset with both the Pandas data frame using the Pandas API from pyspark and the spark dataframe.

Modified the column and row values through the column and altered them with Pandas and spark data type functions and methods.
